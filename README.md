# NEXUS

**Nexus**: A specialized area of the cell membrane involved in intercellular communication and adhesion; a synapse.

This is a biologically-inspired approach to creating a neural network.

## Algorithms and Mechanics
Singular neuron level:

- [x] Hodgkin-huxley model of neuron membrane potential updates
- [x] Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model for neuronal spiking activity

Synapse level:

- [ ] Spike-timing-dependent plasticity
- [ ] Long-term depression and long-term potentiation

Singular layer level:

- [ ] Self-organizing learning via intrinsic biological properties of synapses
- [ ] Inhibition

Cross-layer (network) level:

- [ ] Bi-directional connectivity

## UI Features
Not much, but hey I'm only one person

- [x] Graph of individual neuron test firing
